                        All technologies have a socio-political aspect which, if
                        ignored, can have negative repercussions on the Network

                            directs the development and management of the Veres

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Community Group decisions are made by consensus and
                            sent to the Board of Governors for review and voting.
                            The Board of Governors vote to accept or reject
                            Community Group decisions based on their compliance
                            with the Veres One Mission.
                            Meetings are open to the public and minutes are made
                            available in a public github repository. Anyone can

                        <p>
                            The Board of Governors is responsible for ensuring
                            the stability of the socio-political and economic
                            operation of the Veres One Network.

                        <p>
                            Decisions made by the Community Group must be
                            approved by the Board of Governors to take effect.

                            If Community Group proposals are accepted they are
                            sent to Veres One Foundation staff to be
                            implemented. If proposals are rejected Board members
                            who reject proposals reply to the community group
                            with a justification for the rejection.

                            that advise the Board of Governors and the Veres One
                            Community Group on technical, legal, and community

                        The Veres One Network is designed to be a self-sustaining
                        global public utility with a proper balance of economic
                        incentives to participate in and protect the network.
                        The technology and governance framework are designed to
                        drive down the cost of decentralized identifiers to
                        commodity pricing.

                        Unlike many other blockchain networks, Veres One does
                        not use a scarce network token. This removes price
                        volatility and regulatory risks associated with
                        speculative token networks. Veres One charges low,
                        stable fees that decrease as the network scales.
